***Description***
The goal of the project is to investigate position models for robot localization based on odometry using wheel 
encoder data. Localization = Estimation of (x, y, q). 

- To do the above in two ways:

  o Using the exact circle equations;

  o Using the Borenstein approximation. 
- To compare the two sets of results. 
- To understand the limitations (errors) associated with the odometry approach from the above experiments.

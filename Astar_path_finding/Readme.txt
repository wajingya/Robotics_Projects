***Description***
To achieve the Astar algorithm.

***The specific task***

1. Create a temple map, and set start position and goal position.

2. Use A star algorithm to find the path. At the mean time, mark the current visiting cell with the light color.

3. Finally, mark the whole path on the map.

***Execution***

Please just press the run is ok.

***Pay attention:***

1. Change the （X_start, Y_start）and （X_final, Y_final）as you want to check our A star Algorithm demo;
Pay attention: Because the map limiting, the range of the above four variables is [1 21];

2. How to change the map?

If you want to change the map, you can change the map matrix in the map function as you want. But also the boundary parameter in surrounding_function should also be change.

3. Make sure the following functions are in the same path as the main.m:Comparing_G_function,Gfunction,Hfunction,map,Mark,Surrounding_function
